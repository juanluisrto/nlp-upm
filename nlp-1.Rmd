## Annotation
The corresponding file to my DNI is the following "cv493_12839.txt". It has been the only one utilized since my computer could not handle the whole corpus.

Here we can see the first senteces of the file

```{r cars}
inspect(corpus[[1]])
```
Example of word, sentence and part-of-speech annotations:

#### Word
```{r cars}
head(tagged_words(doc), 10)
```

 
#### Tagged annotations in sentence
```{r cars}
head(tagged_sents(doc),2)
```
#### Part of speech in sentence
```{r cars}

head(parsed_sents(doc),2)
```
we can confirm that the tagging and parsing is moreless consistent and makes sense.
